Car_Rental_System

📌 Project Overview
Car_Rental_System is a Java-based console application developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It provides basic functionality to manage car rentals, including car inventory, customer details, and rental transactions.

This project helps in understanding how real-world systems can be implemented using OOP features like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

📘 OOP Concepts Implemented
Encapsulation: All class variables are private with public getters/setters

Inheritance: (Optional) Could be used to create different car types like Sedan, SUV etc.

Polymorphism: Method overriding (if applicable in rental calculations or car types)

Abstraction: Logic is separated into service classes, hiding internal implementation


🧠 Future Enhancements
GUI using Java Swing or JavaFX

Persistent storage with a database (MySQL, SQLite, etc.)

User login/authentication system

Integration as a web application using Spring Boot

📚 Learning Outcomes
Practical use of Java OOP concepts

System design and modular coding experience

Better understanding of real-world application logic
